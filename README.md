# LiFi_Phy
A Li-Fi PHY receiver and transmitter (primarily for testing the receiver module) using Verilog. Employing the DC-Reduced Hadamard Coded Modulation technique, I assessed the systemâ€™s efficacy using MATLAB. The receiver design encompassed multiple phases, including demodulation (PAM) and decoding incorporating CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)
